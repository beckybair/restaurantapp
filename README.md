# Restaurant Review App Project - Stage 1

This project is #5 of the Udacity FEND Grow with Google Nanodegree program 2018.
We were to alter the existing app for responsiveness, accessibility and service worker caching for offline viewing as per the requirements in the Project Rubric.

## Live Viewing
Here is a link to view the site/app live:  

## Instructions
_Run this on your device_

You can either clone or download the zip file.  Once on your computer, navigate to the location you saved it.  Open the folder and double click the index.html file.  This will open the feed app locally in your browser. You will see the default feed list of items. 


## Dependecies
All dependecies are included as links in the index.html file.  There shouldn't be anything you need to add to run this code.

Also uses [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for the mapping part of the application.  You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

NOTE:  I have removed my API Key as it is not proper to include it in a public repository.


### The links include:
CSS:
* Normalize
* LeafLet 1.3.1

JS:
* LeafLet 1.3.1
* LazyLoadXT 1.1.0
* jQuery 2.1.1

NOTE:  This YouTube video by Traversy Media helped me to understand the Service Worker part and to get mine working:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksXwaWHCW6k&feature=youtu.be

This YouTube video by a fellow Udacity Grow with Google classmate (Doug Brown) helped me to understand what all needed to be done as an overview to get me started.  Want to give credit to him:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92dtrNU1GQc
